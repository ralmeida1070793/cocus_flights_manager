# Cocus Flights Manager 

Cocus Expertise demonstration - Exercise 1 

This application aims to provide the functionalities identified in the first challenge: 

* CRUD of flights 

* Calculation of the distance and fuel consumption for a given aeroplane in a given flight 

It was also provided the following functionalities: 

* CRUD of aeroplanes 

* CRUD of airports 

The application consists in a RESTApi developed in .Net Core 2.2 and a frontend developed in React that consumes the services provided by the API. 

The RESTApi was developed taking into consideration the Test Driven Development methodology, as well as a modular architecture, in which a class library was created in the solution in order to encapsulate the Database logic, the Business Services Logic and the Entity Models. In addition, the architecture takes special emphasis in Generalization through templated interfaces, Dependency injection, as well as MVVM patterns. 

The persistence of the data was assured by an SQLExpress database, created by the Code-First methodology. 

It's worth notice that I didn't have had any experience with REACT prior to this exercise, but I welcome any opportunity to learn something new. 

Thanks for the challenge. It was fun.
